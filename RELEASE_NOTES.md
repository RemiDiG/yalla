# YALLA: an LL library for Coq

### v 2.0.1

Tested with Coq v 8.12.0.

## v 2.0 (2019/01/23)

This major revision is based on a representation of proofs in `Type` rather than `Prop`.
For this reason it is *not compatible with version 1.0*.

Many results have been added, including:

* general cut admissibility proof for Intuitionistic Linear Logic;
* more general conservativity results for Classical Linear Logic over Intuitionistic Linear Logic;
* theory of focusing;
* example files for additional related systems;
* definition of the microyalla kernel.

Tested with Coq v 8.9.0.

## v 1.0 (2017/07/18)

First public release.
